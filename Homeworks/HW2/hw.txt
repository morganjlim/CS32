homework 2
question 2:
(3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 4) (1, 4) (1, 3)
(1, 2) (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 3) (4, 5) (5, 5)
question 4:
(3, 5) (4, 5) (3, 6) (5, 5) (3, 3) (2, 4)
(6, 5) (5, 4) (1, 4) (7, 5) (5, 3) (1, 3)
The two algorithms differ in the way that they access each coordinate. While a stack always
looks at the most recently recorded coordinate, the queue looks at the oldest recorded coordinate.
Essentially, stacks are always first-in-last-out, while queues are first-in-first-out.
